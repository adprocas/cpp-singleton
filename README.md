# C++ Singleton example using C++11 and Windows.h

I believe that using smart pointers makes the Singleton thread safe.  I have provided a small test at the beginning of the program with multiple threads.

I've opted to change this to using mutex instead of critical sections.

If you have any comments or suggestions to make this better, or if you know why it wouldn't work properly, please let me know.
